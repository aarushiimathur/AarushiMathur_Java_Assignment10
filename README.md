# Java Multithreading 

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates how to use **threads** to run multiple tasks **simultaneously** using the `Runnable` interface.

##  What this program does

- Defines a `Task` class that implements `Runnable`, where each task prints numbers from 1 to 5.
- Creates two threads, each running a separate task.
- Starts both threads, allowing them to run **in parallel**.
- Shows how multithreading allows tasks to run independently at the same time.
